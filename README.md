# Loading EMNIST Letter Dataset
When exploring various was to import the EMNIST dataset we came across a pre-made Python library called [emnist](https://pypi.org/project/emnist/) which made loading the various sets of data into our project straight forward and simple. After a few custom functions we were able to generate quick visualizations of the letters along with their labels.

# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
During the data exploration stage we applied several dimensionality reduction techniques to better visualize how the letter images could be clustered together. The highlights are PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is a good baseline technique and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) which provide clearer clusters and better separation. Images shown below and full code can be found in the [dev_notebooks folder](https://github.com/coryroyce/emnist_letter_exploration_and_prediction/blob/main/dev_notebooks/Letter_Exploration_and_Classification_V04.ipynb).

# ML Model
After creating a few different versions of a Tensorflow Deep Neural Net we ultimately used an architecture that did well in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/25-million-images-0-99757-mnist) with the 0-9 MNIST digit data set.

# User Application
To create an interactive experience for users to draw handwritten digits and provide model prediction in real time, we used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to create our [front end application](https://github.com/coryroyce/emnist_letter_exploration_and_prediction/tree/main/streamlit_application). This demo can easily be run in out [Streamlit_App.ipynb](https://github.com/coryroyce/emnist_letter_exploration_and_prediction/blob/main/streamlit_application/Streamlit_App.ipynb) Colab notebook.

# Web Deployment

To make our Letter drawing prediction application as accessible as possible we created a self contained web app and deployed it using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) which can be found in the [heroku_app folder](https://github.com/coryroyce/emnist_letter_exploration_and_prediction/tree/main/heroku_app).
